# MuSpaghetti Studio
## Description
MuSpaghetti Studio is an application that offers the user a virtual experience of a
musical studio through image processing and computer vision techniques. The app
uses the front-facing camera of the hosting device to start a real time video capturing
where the user is surrounded with a number of virtual different musical instruments,
placed at certain positions on the video screen. The user can interface virtually with
these instruments by hitting them with a tracked object (stick for example) to produce
the assigned sound to this musical tool.
The user can use the GUI to import the desired sound and image then assign them to
one of the available positions on screen. There are three different ways of musical instrument
interfacing user can decide between, First option is ON/OFF (i.e. once the tool is hit it goes on
until it is hit back again to go off).
Second option is On Hit (i.e. the tool produces the assigned sound only on being hit).
Last option is Pause/Resume (Similar to ON/OFF but just continue the sound where you left off)
The user also is able import a full sound track to run in the
background with his own remix .
Once starting the video capturing, the app control is switched to the Hand Gestures,
the user can test the instruments sounds until he/she gives the hand sign of record
starting. The GUI keeps recording the played music until the user gives the stop
recording sign, When the camera is turned off, user is switched back to the GUI to playback
the recorded sound track and decide whether to save or delete it as he/she wishes.

# MuSpaghetti Studio
## Description
MuSpaghetti Studio offers the user a virtual experience of a musical studio through image processing and computer vision techniques. The app uses the front-facing camera of the hosting device to start a real time video capturing where the user is surrounded with a number of virtual different musical instruments. The user can interface virtually with these instruments by hitting them with a tracked object(stick) to produce the assigned sound to this musical tool.  

User can import the desired sound and image then assign them to one of the available positions on screen. There are three different ways of musical instrument interfaces user can decide between. First option is ON/OFF (i.e. once the tool is hit it goes on until it is hit back again to go off). Second option is On Hit (i.e. the tool produces the assigned sound only on being hit). Last option is Pause/Resume (Similar to ON/OFF but just continue the sound where you left off) User can also import a full sound track to run in the background with his own remix.

Once starting the video capturing, The app control is switched to the Hand Gestures. User can test the instruments sounds until he/she gives the hand sign of record starting. The app keeps recording the played music until the user gives the stop recording sign. When the camera is turned off, User is switched back to the GUI to playback the recorded sound track and decide whether to save or delete it as he/she wishes.
